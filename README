Installation:
  in this directory,
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make

Usage:
  In this directory, where img_detect.jpg is the image you would like to run
  the cascade detector on.
     ./cascade (img_detect.jpg) >(detection_count_output)
  This will continually detect objects in the image at that path, outputing the
  object count to std out for redirection. Be sure to run the cascade binary
  in this directory so it can find the learned cascade models in the directory
  above.
